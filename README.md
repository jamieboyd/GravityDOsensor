# GravityDOsensor
A .NET library and sample application for the [Gravity dissolved oxygen sensor](https://atlas-scientific.com/embedded-solutions/dissolved-oxygen-meter/) using Wilderness Lab's [Meadow Foundation API](https://developer.wildernesslabs.co/docs/api/Meadow.Foundation/) with support for the [ProjectLab v3](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/collections/frontpage/products/project-lab-board). The code should work with any analog dissolved oxygen sensor.
